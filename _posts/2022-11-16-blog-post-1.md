I am happy to share that today I successfully passed my doctoral defense for earning a PhD in Civil Engineering at the University of Michigan. I want to sincerely thank my advisor [Prof. Neda Masoud](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/masoud-neda/) and all my dissertation committee members including [Prof. Mingyan Liu](https://liu.engin.umich.edu/), [Prof. Garbor Orosz](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~orosz/), and [Prof. Yafeng Yin](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/yin-yafeng/)!
