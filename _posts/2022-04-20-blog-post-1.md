On April 20 2022, I defended my PhD thesis proposal titled "Cybersecurity in Connected and Automated Transportation Systems". Many thanks to my dissertation committee including my advisor [Prof. Neda Masoud](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/masoud-neda/), [Prof. Mingyan Liu](https://liu.engin.umich.edu/), [Prof. Garbor Orosz](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~orosz/), and [Prof. Yafeng Yin](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/yin-yafeng/)!
