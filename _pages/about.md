<!-- # About Me -->
* I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), who is advised by Prof. [Neda Masoud](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/masoud-neda/) with specialization in [Next Generation Transportation Systems](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/research/infrastructure/transportation/). I am currently working at [Next Generation Mobility Systems Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nmasoud/index.html).
* One of my research interests focuses on the cybersecurity of intelligent transportation systems, particularly on anomaly detection, adversarial bandit learning, and algorithmic game theory with applications in connected and automated vehicle technologies. Another line of my research lies in combinatorial optimization, including peer-to-peer ride-matching, graph coarsening, and aggregation/disaggregation algorithms. 
* I received my Master's Degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) with specialization in [Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/research/research-areas/signal-image-processing-and-machine-learning/), and Bachelor's Degree in [College of Communications Engineering](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/ENGLISH/HOM.htm) at [Jilin University](http://global.jlu.edu.cn/) with cumulative GPA ranking top 1/91.
