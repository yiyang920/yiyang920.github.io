<!-- # About Me -->
* I am a Ph.D. candidate 
<!-- in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/)  -->
at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), who is advised by [Prof. Neda Masoud](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/masoud-neda/) with specialization in [Next Generation Transportation Systems](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/research/infrastructure/transportation/). I am currently working at [Next Generation Mobility Systems Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nmasoud/index.html).
* I received my Master's Degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan, with specialization in [Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/research/research-areas/signal-image-processing-and-machine-learning/), and Bachelor's Degree in [College of Communications Engineering](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/ENGLISH/HOM.htm) at [Jilin University](http://global.jlu.edu.cn/) with cumulative GPA ranking top 1/91 and National Scholarship Award. 
* One line of my research interests focuses on the vehicle motion tracking and prediction, and cybersecurity of intelligent transportation systems, particularly on anomaly detection, adversarial bandit learning, and algorithmic game theory with applications in the connected and automated vehicle technologies. Another line of my research lies in combinatorial optimization, including peer-to-peer ride-matching, graph coarsening, and aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.
