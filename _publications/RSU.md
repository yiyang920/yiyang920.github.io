## Abstract
Our main objective in this study is to implement an anomaly detection solution on RSUs to detect anomalies within CAV sensors or attacks/faults within the communication channel, and recover the corrupt signals by utilizing the information from multiple road users whose motions are affected by one another. To this end, we put forward a physics-based fault detector that can operate in a mixed traffic environment.
